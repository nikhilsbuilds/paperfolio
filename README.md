I’ve been experimenting with **V0 - by Vercel**, and I rebuilt the popular **Paperfolio** layout originally created by **Brix Templates**.
This is a community-made clone — all ownership of the original design stays with @brixtemplatesbrixtemplates.
My goal was simply to recreate it in V0 so anyone can use or remix it.
